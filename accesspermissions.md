Change an employee’s access permissions

In the CareerPlug Applicant Tracking System, there are four access levels: Admin, Full Access, Limited Access, and No Recruiting Access. Each access level gives employees varying permissions: 

Admin
Can customize account settings, add new employees, post jobs, and move applicants through a hiring process. Have access to all jobs, locations, and applicants.
Full Access
Can post jobs and move applicants through a hiring process for selected locations only. Full access employees must be associated with at least one location in order to take any action. Learn more.
Limited Access
Can move applicants through a hiring process for selected locations only. Limited access employees must be associated with at least one location in order to take any action. Learn more.
No Recruiting Access
Do not have access to any jobs or locations. An employee with "No Recruiting Access" has the ability to take assessments only.

Changing a user's access level
Only account admins can change the access levels of other employees. If you're not an admin, contact one to give you or someone else a different level of access.
Follow these steps to change an employee’s access level:
Click Settings in the top right navigation menu.
Click the My Organization tab.
Click the Team card at the bottom left of the screen.

Find the employee's name (you can use the search box at the top right to search for them by name).
Once you have located the employee, click the Edit button.

Scroll to the Access heading. Change the level of access by selecting the appropriate radio button.

Click Save.
