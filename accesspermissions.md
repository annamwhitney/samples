Change an employeeâ€™s access permissions

In the CareerPlug Applicant Tracking System, there are four access levels: Admin, Full Access, Limited Access, and No Recruiting Access. Each access level gives employees varying permissions: 

Admin

Full Access
Can post jobs and move applicants through a hiring process for selected locations only. Full access employees must be associated with at least one location in order to take any action. Learn more.
Limited Access
Can move applicants through a hiring process for selected locations only. Limited access employees must be associated with at least one location in order to take any action. Learn more.
No Recruiting Access
Do not have access to any jobs or locations. An employee with "No Recruiting Access" has the ability to take assessments only.
